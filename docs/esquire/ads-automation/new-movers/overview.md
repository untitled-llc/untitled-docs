This process is used to automate the transformation of Avrick New Mover's data to a custom segment in Xandr or a custom audience in Facebook. The Avrick New Mover's data is a collection of self-reported changes of address by the mover themselves. It returns an FTP delivered csv file containing all of the mover's new addresses 
across the United States, for that week.
