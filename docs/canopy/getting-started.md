Welcome to the Canopy-KY business education and certification website documentation!

Boy that was a mouthful ðŸ˜…

to get started locally first clone the repo for the canopy portal:

```
git clone git@github.com:Canopy-Certified-Inc/portal-front-end.git
```

*Note: the link above is for ssh-key authenticated cloning. For HTTPS use* [https://github.com/Canopy-Certified-Inc/portal-front-end.git](https://github.com/Canopy-Certified-Inc/portal-front-end.git)

Before running the site locally install all dependencies with: 

```
yarn install
```

Then start the webserver with:

```
yarn start
```

You should have a site running at [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000)
